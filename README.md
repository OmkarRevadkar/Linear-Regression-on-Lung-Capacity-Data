Linear Regression is a supervised learning model. It uses regression algorithm where our target variable is continuous. Sampling is possible and we have performed it on Lung Capacity Dataset. Finally, we have also removed outliers to the best possible extent.

Following steps are involved: 
1. Import the necessary libraries in our Jupyter notebook.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Perform Data Cleaning -- fill missing values, standardization, normalization, etc.
4. Random Sampling with splitting data into train and test data.
5. Build the model with linear regression on train -- fit on train.
6. Predict on test. 
7. Evaluate the model using various parameters.
 8. Fixing the errors and outliers to make the model perform better
